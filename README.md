# Yup-NVSE
Howdy.

# How to Install

Download the [Yup](https://github.com/ipv451/Yup/releases/download/Yup/Yup_1.0.rar) in the releases tab or clink the link.

Then Grab your mod manager.  Mine is [Mod Organizer 2](https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer).  Drag the rar into the Downloads tab then install.

# Manual Install

Extract the Files, you should see a NVSE folder and a meta file.  The meta file is just some copyright stuff, the only important thing is the NVSE folder.  Before you drag the file in, make sure you have [The New Vegas Script Extender](https://github.com/xNVSE/NVSE) installed.  When loaded it should just run.

Thats it!
